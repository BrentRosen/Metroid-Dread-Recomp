   and their pictures beside it as users/<uid>.jpg. User 1 has the uid users.ini gives it; with none (no users.ini, or
   a [user1] without one) the uid ScarletNX always gave it (SNX_USERS_FIRST_UID0 and 1), so the saves made before there
   were others stay its own. Without users.ini it is the only user, "Player". A nickname follows the rule of Eden's
