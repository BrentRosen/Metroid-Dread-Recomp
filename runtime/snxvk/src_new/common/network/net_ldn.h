/* Local wireless (ldn) over the LAN, speaking the protocol of the ldn_mitm sysmodule (spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm, MIT),
   which Ryujinx's LdnMitm client speaks too, so a ScarletNX finds the networks of another ScarletNX, of a Ryujinx or
   of a console running ldn_mitm on the same network. UDP port 11452 carries the scan (a Scan broadcast on the
   interface's broadcast address, answered with the host's NetworkInfo), TCP 11452 on the host carries the session (a
   station sends its NodeInfo, the host sends the whole NetworkInfo to every station whenever it changes; closing the
   connection is leaving). The game's own traffic goes straight to the nodes' addresses through its sockets.

   One SnxLdn per emulated console. Its thread receives; the calls below are made from the guest's threads and never
   wait with the lock held. The structures are the guest's (nn::ldn), little-endian, laid out byte for byte. */
